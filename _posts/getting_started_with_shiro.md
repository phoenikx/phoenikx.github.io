## PART 1: Awesome RBAC with Apache Shiro

###Story:
Once I had to implement RBAC in one of my projects. Specifically, the goal was to allow role and user-group based access to resources in the system. After evaluating Spring Security and Apache Shiro, I decided to use Shiro mainly because I found it simpler to use and it is container independent. 

###Agenda:

1. Getting started with Apache Shiro
2. Authentication using Oauth


### 1. Getting started with Apache Shiro
If I have to explain Shiro using a single picture, I'd like to use this.
