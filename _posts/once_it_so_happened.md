# Once it so happened


Though I am a software engineer by profession, I am a story teller by heart. Having read hundreds of
technical blogs so far, I feel that there are not many story-driven technical blogs around on the internet. So here I am, starting a series called **Once it so happened** where blogs will contain not only the technical details
of the solution being proposed, but also the story around why that problem came in the first place.

So allow me to take you on a journey of exploring so many exciting technologies around on the internet. I am already excited about it, are you too?
